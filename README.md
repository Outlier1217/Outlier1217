💡 Core Philosophy
Autonomy Over Governance
I believe financial systems should execute deterministically rather than relying on human governance. My projects eliminate:

Admin keys and multisig controls

Emergency pause functions

Offchain automation dependencies

Emotion-driven decision making

Privacy by Design
Web3 applications should respect user sovereignty by default:

Wallet-only authentication

Zero personal data collection

Onchain identity preservation

Trust-minimized interactions

Blockchain-Native UX
Leveraging blockchain properties to create superior experiences:

Instant settlement capabilities

Transparent execution flows

Permissionless participation

Composability and interoperability
